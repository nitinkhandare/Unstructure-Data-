### AMAZON CUSTEMER REVIEW SENTIMENT ANALISIS

In this project you will use bag-of-words representations of Amazon reviews to predict the sentiments that the reviews express. The bag-of-words representation is constructed from counts of the top 1,000 words appearing in the reviews, excluding a list of such stop words as "and" and "the." These words are also stemmed, so that words such as "want" and "wanted" are collapsed into a single feature. For each review, a label of 0 indicates a 1 or 2-star review, while a label of 1 indicates a 4 or 5-star review. Note that 3-star reviews, i.e. Those expressing a neutral sentiment, are not included in this dataset.
