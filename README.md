# Unstructure-Data-Analysis

### AMAZON CUSTEMER REVIEW SENTIMENT ANALISIS

In this project, I have done unstructured data analysis like data collection or scrapping from amazon website then data processing and preparation like missing value treatment and data filtering like removing the stop words, white spaces, symbols etc.
then I have performed the following data analysis operations
1. Unstructured Data Analysis
2. Text mining
3. Sentiment Analysis
4. topic modeling

In this project you will use bag-of-words representations of Amazon reviews to predict the sentiments that the reviews express. The bag-of-words representation is constructed from counts of the top 1,000 words appearing in the reviews, excluding a list of such stop words as "and" and "the." These words are also stemmed, so that words such as "want" and "wanted" are collapsed into a single feature. For each review, a label of 0 indicates a 1 or 2-star review, while a label of 1 indicates a 4 or 5-star review. Note that 3-star reviews, i.e. Those expressing a neutral sentiment, are not included in this dataset.
